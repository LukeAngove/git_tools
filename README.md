# Git Tools

Tools for working with Git.

Tools in this repository work on the idea that having multiple working trees checked out is the norm.

All git repos are cloned bare in the $HOME/git/<repo-name> directory, with branches checked out as separate working directories
in $HOME/workspace/<repo-name>/<branch-path>. Branches that contain '/' will have nested folders.
